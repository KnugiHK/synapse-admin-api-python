# synapse-admin-api-python
A Python wrapper for Matrix Synapse admin API

This library is now support up to Synapse 1.25.0, any Admin API introduced after 1.25.0 will not be include in this version. However, newer chnages of Admin API are planned to be included in this library. For planned update, see [TODO.md](TODO.md). In the future, the version numbering convention will follow the version this library up to, for exmaple, if this library is support up to 1.26.0, then the version number of this library will be 1.26.0.
